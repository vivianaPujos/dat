## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

```{r}
# load package and data
library(ggplot2)
data(mpg, package="ggplot2")
# mpg <- read.csv("http://goo.gl/uEeRGu")

mpg_select <- mpg[mpg$manufacturer %in% c("audi", "ford", "honda", "hyundai"), ]

# Scatterplot
theme_set(theme_bw())  # pre-set the bw theme.
g <- ggplot(mpg_select, aes(displ, cty)) + 
  labs(subtitle="mpg: Displacement vs City Mileage",
       title="Bubble chart")

g + geom_jitter(aes(col=manufacturer, size=hwy)) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(col=manufacturer), method="lm", se=F)
```


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(highcharter)
data(diamonds, mpg, package = "ggplot2")

hchart(mpg, "scatter", hcaes(x = displ, y = hwy, group = class)) %>%
  hc_title(text = "DispersiÃ³n diamonds") %>%
  hc_add_theme(hc_theme_economist())
```
